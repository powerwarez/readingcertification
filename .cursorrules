# Codebase Overview

This codebase is part of a web application built using TypeScript, React, and shadcn/UI components. It is structured to support a landing page, authentication flows, and a dashboard for logged-in users. The application integrates with Supabase for backend services, including Kakao authentication and database interactions.

# Stack and Key Technologies

- **Frontend Framework**: Remix (latest version with React Router)
- **TypeScript**: Used for type-safe code across the frontend
- **shadcn/UI**: A React UI library used for building the UI components like buttons, modals, inputs, etc.
- **Supabase**: An open-source Firebase alternative used for backend services like authentication, database, and storage
- **Kakao OAuth**: Used with Supabase for authentication
- **Iconify/Lucide**: For icons across the application

# Purpose and Functionality

## Authentication

The application includes a comprehensive authentication flow:
- **Login**: Users can log in using Kakao Auth integrated with Supabase OAuth
- **Signup**: New users can sign up with Kakao Auth
- **Logout**: Users can log out

## User Interface

- **Landing Page**: Contains components like SubmitButton, LoginPage, and LogoutModal to facilitate user interactions
- **Dashboard**: For logged-in users, showing personalized content and a sidebar for navigation within the dashboard
- **Error Handling**: A generic error component is used to display errors and provide a retry mechanism

## Navigation and Layout

- **Navbar**: A responsive navbar for the landing page and possibly other public pages
- **Sidebar**: A collapsible sidebar for the dashboard, indicating a more complex, multi-page application structure for authenticated users
- **Routing**: Uses Remix's routing system with React Router for navigation between pages and layouts

## Data Fetching

- **Supabase Client**: Used for database interactions and user authentication
- **Remix Loaders/Actions**: For server-side data fetching and form submissions
- **Type-safe API**: TypeScript interfaces ensure type safety across API boundaries
